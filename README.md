- 👋 Hi, I am just a very curious self-taught developer. There are two things I live for, learning and building. 
 
- 👀 I’m interested in Full Stack software development. In particular, Javascript, Automation (Puppeteer), ReactJS, NextJS, NodeJS, Redis, PWAs, Chrome Extensions, Docker, Firebase, React Native.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Pythton backend development, Elastic Search, Kubernetes and D3JS. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting full stack projects or frontend features.
