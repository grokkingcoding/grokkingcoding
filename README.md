- 👋 Hi, I am glad you are here. Follow me on my self-taught coding journey. I always believe the best way to learn something is to learn it like you will teach it. Currently, my life revolves around two things, learning, building and teaching.  
 
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack software development. In particular, Javascript, Automation (Puppeteer), ReactJS, NextJS, NodeJS, Redis, PWAs, Chrome Extensions, Docker, Firebase, React Native.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Pythton backend development, Elastic Search, Kubernetes and D3JS. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting full stack projects or frontend features.
